# NServiceBus.NHibernate Samples

## Outbox Sample
This sample shows how to enable the Outbox feature in NServiceBus.

Out of the box this sample uses RabbitMQ as the default transport, if you would rather use MSMQ you need to do [some changes](http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/no-dtc#supported-transports) to the source code.
